BrainFix v0.42

Tested successfully with g++-4.6 and g++-4.7. Not compatible with
older versions of GCC.

To install, make the install.sh script executable:
    $ chmod u+x install.sh
And run:
    $ ./install.sh
    
This should generate 2 executables:
- bfx
- bf2c

The first is the BrainFix compiler, which can be used to translate
a BrainFix source file into the BrainFuck Language.

The resulting BrainFuck-source can then be translated using the second 
executable: bf2c. This will generate a C-source file which can be compiled 
with a C-compiler of your choice.

See also the manual (manual.pdf) for the language and compilation details.
Happy BrainFucking/Fixing!
